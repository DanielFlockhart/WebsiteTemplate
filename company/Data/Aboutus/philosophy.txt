Asimovs 3 Laws:
- A Program may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

- A Program must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 

- A Program must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

These 3 Laws respresent what we stand for. If a program/solution does not provide absolute value for the majority of those it influences. It will be discontinued. Our goal, as a company and a force for good is to not only advance the technology that dictates our lives, but preserve the light of consciousness. Culture, Community and creation are some of the key parts of what we believe it means to be human.
